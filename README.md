# Easy-genomic-centric-metagenomics-pipepline
Integrate well-established methods to conduct genomic-centric metagenomics for researchers who are busy in wet experiments but have no time in learning bioinformatics.  
* This pipeline is easy to use with only 2parameters, namely, the directory with paired-end fastq and the number of threads, required.  
* All parameters are refered to published papers and suitable for most of the situations.  
* For advanced researchers, changing parameters manually is possible and welcomed.  
* More functions including phylogenetic analysis, taxonomic classification, function annotation and ploting are under development.  
* Hope to assist your metagenomic analysis from raw sequences to publishable figures.
