# Easy-genomic-centric-metagenomics-pipepline
Integrate well-established methods to conduct genomic-centric metagenomics for researchers who are busy in wet experiment but have no time in learning bioinformatics. This pipeline is easy to use with only 2parameters, namely, the directory with paired-end fastq and the number of threads, required.
